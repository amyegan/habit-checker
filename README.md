# Getting Started on Your First Project

1. Come up with an idea
   - common, uninspiring suggestions: calculator, to-do list
   - Slime Rancher plort market chart - maximize your plort profits
   - practice quiz app - add questions all semester and use it to study for final exam
   - habit tracker - keep track of the days you did something that you're trying to make a habit
   - rock, paper, scissors bot - convince your friends to do it to so you can compete
   - chrome extension - make something useful or funny to share with everyone
   - static resume page - push it to Netlify and you've got your own website! (note: Be careful not to share personal info like phone or address when publishing)
2. Identify your own requirements
   - Way to input highest plort prices
   - Way to input acceptable tolerance %
   - Calculate x% less than the highest price for that type
   - Way to save the inputed plort prices for future use
   - CSS styling (maybe just Milligram or Bootstrap)
3. Pick one foundational feature. Build the most basic version to start.
   - Building the HTML page with inputs to accept plort prices
4. After that is built, pick one more feature that can be added on top of this.
   - Add tolerance % input to the page
5. After the new feature is added, identify another small feature and add it. Repeat.
   - Calculate allowable % less than max
   - Display the lowest tolerable prices next to the highest prices
   - Save the input values to a JSON file
   - Load the previously input values from the JSON file
   - Add some CSS or a CSS framework so it looks better

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Focus on getting it to work first, then refactor to make it a "better" solution.
