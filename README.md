# Getting Started on Your First Project

## Build Your Own Project

1. Come up with an idea
   - common, uninspiring suggestions: calculator, to-do list
   - practice quiz app - add questions all semester and use it to study for final exam
   - habit tracker - keep track of the days you did something that you're trying to make a habit
   - text-based game - make a choose-your-own adventure story
   - rock, paper, scissors bot - convince your friends to do it to so you can compete
   - chrome extension - make something useful or funny to share with everyone
   - static resume page - push it to Netlify and you've got your own website! (note: Be careful not to share personal info like phone or address when publishing)
2. Identify your own requirements
   - button to mark habit done today
   - list of times button was clicked
   - save record
   - load record from storage
   - css styling
3. Pick one foundational feature. Build the most basic version to start. Take notes on any new ideas that come to you while building this, but don't let them distract you.
   - Building the HTML page with a button and a list
4. After that is built, pick one more feature that can be added on top of this. Write down ideas that you have while building this, but don't get sidetracked.
   - Add tolerance % input to the pIdentify your own requirementsage
5. After the new feature is added, identify another small feature and add it. Repeat.
   - Calculate allowable % less than max
   - Display the lowest tolerable prices next to the highest prices
   - Save the input values to a JSON file
   - Load the previously input values from the JSON file
   - Add some CSS or a CSS framework so it looks better

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Focus on getting it to work first, then refactor to make it a "better" solution.

### New Requirement Notes

- prevent duplicate records
- click button on date to toggle record done/not done
- grid to display habit record
